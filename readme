Outlining the steps taken to integrate Contently Headless CMS into my Next.js application.

Before starting, I made sure i had the following:

An active Contently account
API access credentials (API Key and Secret)
A Next.js application set up

Created a space in Contentful
Created a content model (camera) and setup fields with corresponding fieldtypes (image-media, model-shorttext, brand-shorttext, price-integer)
Filled up the Content tab by adding entries (which can be edited) to the fields
Published to update the status of each field.
Went to setting to find the API Keys needed.

Created a .env file to save my CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN values on it

Created a utility or lib folder and created contentfulClient.js file inside it (lib/contentfulClient.js)

In the contentfulClient.js file, I set up the API client with the Contently API

Created a pages folder where I created an index.js file

In the index.js script, I fetched the content by importing it from lib/contentfulClient.js

Created a styles.css within the pages folder for app aesthetics and better user experience

Tested output. Here are a few among many errors encountered:
~ module not found
~ fetch Errors
~ network errors - i changed (localhost:8080) to (localhost:3000) on launch.json and it worked
