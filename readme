Outlining the steps taken to integrate Contently Headless CMS into my Next.js application.

Before starting, I made sure i had the following:

An active Contently account
API access credentials (API Key and Secret)
A Next.js application set up

Created a .env file to save my CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID and CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN values on it

Created a utility or lib folder and created contentfulClient.js file inside it (lib/contentfulClient.js)

In the contentfulClient.js file, I set up the API client with the Contently API

Created a pages folder where I created an index.js file

In the index.js script, I fetched the content by importing it from lib/contentfulClient.js

Created a styles.css within the pages folder for app aesthetics and better user experience

Tested output. Here are a few among many errors encountered:
~ module not found
~ fetch Errors
~ network errors - i changed (localhost:8080) to (localhost:3000) on launch.json and it worked

Created a new Github Repository

Added my files into the repository
Made my first commit then pushed.

Created a Vercel account and successfully deployed the app >>> ![alt text](<Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 3.57.11â€¯PM.png>)
